  ## Counter: On

  Use the \`.on()\` method to attach event listeners to elements inside your component.
  It takes a selector and an event name joined by \`@\`, and a callback that receives
  the component context — giving you direct access to \`state\` and more.

  \`\`\`
  .on("[selector]@eventName", callback)
  \`\`\`

  The selector works like \`document.querySelector\` scoped to your component's rendered
  output. This means you can target any attribute, class, or element — \`[data-action=increase]\`,
  \`.btn-submit\`, \`input\` — without worrying about conflicts with the rest of the page.

  Inside the callback, updating state is as simple as calling the state property as a
  function with a new value. Ilha will re-render only what changed — so clicking the
  button below updates the count without touching anything else in the DOM.
