  ## Counter: Derived

  Now that you can mutate state with \`.on()\`, derived properties let you compute
  values from that state automatically — recalculating only when their dependencies
  change. Use \`.derived()\` to keep complex logic out of your templates and make
  components easier to reason about.

  \`\`\`
  .derived("name", ({ state }) => /* computed value */)
  \`\`\`

  The callback receives the component context, just like \`.on()\`. The result is
  available in \`.render()\` via \`derived.name.value\`. Unlike state, you never
  write to a derived property directly — it always reflects the latest computed result.

  \`.derived()\` also accepts an async function, making it suitable for data fetching.
  The result exposes \`value\`, \`loading\`, and \`error\` — so you get built-in async
  state without reaching for SWR or TanStack Query.
